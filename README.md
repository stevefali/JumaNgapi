# JumaNgapi
 This was one of my first coding projects. I made this app in 2017 to give myself experience building an Android app from scratch all the way to publishing. I wrote it in Java. It is a pretty basic app; it simply calculates the day of the week for a given calendar date, and how many times in a year a given date falls on a given weekday. I also put banner ads in this app so I could learn how to implement ads in Android. I even gave it a translation for Swahili. Juma Ngapi can also be found on Google Play [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kwendatech.android.jumangapi).

The main files to look at are located at [src/main/java/com/kwendatech/android/jumangapi](src/main/java/com/kwendatech/android/jumangapi).
